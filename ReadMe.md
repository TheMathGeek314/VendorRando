# VendorRando

This Randomizer connection adds the physical locations of various shops to rando, including:
- Sly
- Salubra
- Iselda
- Leg Eater
- Lemm

In order to purchase items or sell relics, you will need to locate them at a random placement.
The vanilla locations of each will now be a single check (including Lemm in City).
When creating a rando save, you can enable/disable each individual vendor on the Connections page.


Rescuing Sly in lower Crossroads is not required before interacting with his shop.

Each shop will behave normally, including Sly's additional stock with shopkeeper's key, Salubra's charm requirements for some items, and Leg Eater's discounts with Defender's Crest equipped.


## Integrations
- **CondensedSpoilerLogger**: The condensed log will have a section for Vendors.
- **QoL**: Lemm will still be able to sell all from the right side if the setting is enabled.
- **RandoMapMod**: To avoid spoiling their locations, previewable shop pins are placed in the center of the map just above City Storerooms.
- **RandoSettingsManager**: When sharing a settings code, VendorRando settings will be included.

## Compatibilities
- Lemm's Shop from **MoreLocations** is verified to function as intended.
- Cursed Listening from **LoreRando** works, but vendors do not currently grant lore checks correctly.
- **MultiWorld** is not currently compatible with VendorRando, remote access items cause stock to be inaccessible.
- Area Blitz from **RandoPlus** may cause problems as vendors are not guaranteed to function at full flexible locations.
